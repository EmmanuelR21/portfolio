# Personal Portfolio

This is simply a project to build my own portfolio website.

## Goals

While a template website could build my portfolio website for me in seconds, I do want to use this project as a way to hone my skills on things such as:

1. Improving my ability to create appealing Frontend Designs.
2. Developing my Typescript techniques and coding patterns.
3. Setting up my own Server Hosting.
